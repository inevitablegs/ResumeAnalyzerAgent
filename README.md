## üìù Overview

The **ResumeAnalyzerAgent** is an intelligent, Python-based tool designed to empower job seekers and recruiters alike by providing comprehensive analysis and actionable improvement suggestions for resumes. Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and document parsing techniques, this agent helps users identify strengths, pinpoint areas for improvement, and optimize their resumes for specific job roles.

Whether you're looking to enhance your chances of passing applicant tracking systems (ATS) or aiming for a polished, impactful presentation, ResumeAnalyzerAgent acts as your personal resume consultant. It goes beyond simple keyword matching, offering insights into formatting, readability, content relevance, and overall professional appeal.

*   **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface for quick analysis and insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To get the ResumeAnalyzerAgent up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9 or higher

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ResumeAnalyzerAgent.git
    cd ResumeAnalyzerAgent
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    *   **On macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows**:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    While the project currently relies on core Python capabilities and potentially some standard libraries (like `google_auth_httplib2` for potential external integrations), for robust operation, it's good practice to install all required packages. If a `requirements.txt` is not provided, you might need to install `PyPDF2` or `pdfminer.six` for PDF extraction, and potentially `nltk` or `spacy` for NLP, if they are used by the `tools` modules.
    ```bash
    # If a requirements.txt file exists:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # If not, you might need to manually install core dependencies based on the tools:
    pip install PyPDF2  # For pdf_extractor.py
    # pip install spacy && python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm # Example for NLP
    ```
    *(Note: The `requirements.txt` might contain a comprehensive list of all necessary packages, including `google-auth-httplib2` and others used by the `venv`'s site-packages.)*

## üöÄ Usage

The ResumeAnalyzerAgent is primarily designed as a command-line tool.

### Analyzing a Resume

To analyze a PDF resume, use the `analyze` command followed by the path to your resume file:

```bash
python main.py analyze path/to/your/resume.pdf
```

**Example Output (Simplified):**

```
Resume Analysis Report for resume.pdf:

--- Summary ---
Overall Score: 75/100
Strengths: Clear experience section, good skill variety.
Areas for Improvement: Missing contact email, inconsistent formatting in education.

--- Details ---
[Section: Contact Information]
- Status: Incomplete (Missing Email)
- Recommendation: Ensure full contact details are present (phone, email, LinkedIn).

[Section: Skills]
- Detected Skills: Python, Java, SQL, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Project Management
- Recommendation: Consider adding proficiency levels or specific projects where skills were applied.

[Section: Experience]
- Entries: 2
- Recommendation: Use action verbs at the start of each bullet point. Quantify achievements with numbers.

[Section: Education]
- Status: Inconsistent Formatting
- Recommendation: Standardize university and degree presentation (e.g., "Degree, Major, University, City, State, Graduation Year").

--- Improvement Suggestions ---
1. Add a professional email address to your contact section.
2. Review the education section for consistent formatting.
3. For "Software Developer" role, quantify impact: "Implemented feature X, resulting in Y% performance gain."

Analysis complete.
```

### Getting Improvement Suggestions (Post-Analysis)

While the `analyze` command often provides immediate suggestions, a dedicated `improve` command (if implemented for more detailed or interactive suggestions) could be used as follows:

```bash
# Assuming 'analyze' generates a report that 'improve' can consume
python main.py improve path/to/analysis_report.json
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The ResumeAnalyzerAgent can be configured to fine-tune its analysis and suggestion engine. Configuration options are typically managed via a `config.py` file or a `config.json` / `.ini` file.

**Example `config.py` (Hypothetical):**

```python
# config.py

# NLP Model Configuration
NLP_MODEL_NAME = "en_core_web_sm" # Or a custom trained model

# Analysis Weights
WEIGHTS = {
    "contact_info": 0.15,
    "skills_relevance": 0.25,
    "experience_impact": 0.30,
    "education_clarity": 0.10,
    "formatting_consistency": 0.10,
    "keyword_density": 0.10,
}

# Output Settings
OUTPUT_REPORT_FORMAT = "json" # "json", "txt", "markdown"
SAVE_ANALYSIS_REPORT = True
REPORT_OUTPUT_DIR = "reports/"

# Resume Section Keywords (for detection)
SECTION_KEYWORDS = {
    "experience": ["experience", "work history", "professional background"],
    "education": ["education", "academic background"],
    "skills": ["skills", "abilities", "technical skills", "core competencies"],
    # ... more sections
}
```

You can modify these parameters to customize the analysis sensitivity, output format, or tailor it to specific industry standards.

## üìñ API Documentation

The core functionalities of `ResumeAnalyzerAgent` are encapsulated within its `tools` modules (`analyzer.py`, `improver.py`, `pdf_extractor.py`), which are designed for modularity. While primarily a CLI tool, these modules can be imported and utilized programmatically in other Python applications.

**Example of Programmatic Usage (Conceptual):**

```python
from tools.pdf_extractor import extract_text_from_pdf
from tools.analyzer import ResumeAnalyzer
from tools.improver import ResumeImprover

def process_resume_programmatically(pdf_path):
    # 1. Extract text
    resume_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
    if not resume_text:
        print(f"Could not extract text from {pdf_path}")
        return

    # 2. Analyze the resume
    analyzer = ResumeAnalyzer()
    analysis_results = analyzer.analyze(resume_text)

    # 3. Get improvement suggestions
    improver = ResumeImprover()
    suggestions = improver.generate_suggestions(analysis_results)

    print("\n--- Programmatic Analysis Results ---")
    print(analysis_results)
    print("\n--- Generated Suggestions ---")
    for suggestion in suggestions:
        print(f"- {suggestion}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_resume_programmatically("path/to/your/resume.pdf")
```
*(Further details on specific class methods and parameters would be provided in comprehensive Sphinx/MkDocs documentation.)*
